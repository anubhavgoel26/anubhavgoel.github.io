Hey! I am Anubhav Goel, a final year student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at IIT Bombay pursuing a Dual Degree. I am interested in the fields of **Reinforcement Learning** and **Image Processing**. I plan to use this website to share my projects and some updates about my life.

I worked at Ernst & Young during my sophomore year analyzing fiscal development and developing economic reform startegies for various state governments in India.

Currently, I am working with [Prof. Suyash Awate](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~suyash/) on Biomedical Image Processing using Deep Learning techniques and [Prof. Vivek Borkar](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=Km1V8WwAAAAJ&hl=en) on Policy Gradient Schemes for Constrained Optimization problems.

In the summer of 2020, I interned at McKinsey and Co. as a part of the CIBi team (Corporate and Investment Banking Insights), working in developing end-to-end pipelines for big data processing.

In my free time, I enjoy reading books and playing video games.
