Hey! Hey there! I am Anubhav Goel, a final year student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at IIT Bombay. I am interested in the fields of **Machine Learning** and **Image Processing**. I plan to use this website as a medium for sharing my projects.

I was part of Autonise AI, a small group of machine learning enthusiasts during my sophomore year.
We worked on 2 projects:
* Semantic Segmentation
* Text Detection and Recognition

Currently, I am working with [Prof. Suyash Awate](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~suyash/) on Biomedical Image Processing using Deep Learning techniques.

In the summer of 2020, I interned at McKinsey and Co., working in developing end-to-end pipelines for big data processing.

In my free time, I enjoy reading books and playing video games.
