I enjoy solving problems on HackerRank in my free time. I’m currently ranked in the 3000s globally, in the ‘Algorithms’ track. My aim is to make it to the top 1000. I do it for three simple reasons:

* It improves my logical thinking and exposes me to creative approaches for problem-solving.
* I believe in learning about new algorithms and data structures through their applications.
* Writing code every day helps. A lot. Quick prototyping of a random idea becomes very easy.
