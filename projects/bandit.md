Our IE613 course ended with a course project.
After going through the list of topics, we decided to do a survey of Dueling Bandit algorithms since they are gaining popularity due to the wide range of use cases.

Here's a link to the final report: [Report]({{site.url}}/assets/pdf/bandit_report.pdf)

You can visit my Github [repo](https://github.com/methi1999/dueling-bandits) which contains the entire code.
