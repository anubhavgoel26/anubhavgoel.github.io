I completed the [Python for Data Science](https://www.edx.org/course/python-for-data-science-0) course offered by UC San Diego on edX. For my final course project, I searched Kaggle for various datasets and finalised the ball-by-ball data of the Indian Premier League (IPL).

IPL is the biggest T20 competition in the world of cricket. I have religiously followed each season since it's inception in 2008. This dataset provided me the perfect opportunity to analyse ten years of data and even come up with my very own statistics.

You can find the final presentation [here]({{site.url}}/assets/pdf/ipl.pdf).
I have also uploaded my kernel on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/methi1999/final-project-for-ucsd-dse200x).
