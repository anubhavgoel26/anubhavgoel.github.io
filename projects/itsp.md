After a hectic second semester, it was time for a summer project. I teamed up with 3 classmates and spent a month building a handwriting-recognition pen.

Our main goal was to eliminate the constraint of a special notebook, which most of the market-ready products require. And this is what we came up with:

The documentation can be found [here]({{site.url}}/assets/pdf/itsp_docs.pdf).
It describes our thought process, the obstacles we faced and how we overcame them.
