In the winters of my freshman year, I tried my hand at Machine Learning.

Why ML? Because the promises it made and the results it delivered fascinated me! Self-driving cars, face recognition software, machines which could play games - we see them only in sci-fi movies. I aim to make an impactful contribution, which helps turn these dreams into reality.

I started out with Andrew Ng’s course on [Introduction to Machine Learning on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning#syllabus). I enjoyed it and it sparked further interest in this field.
I then stumbled upon [this](https://www.neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com) amazing web-book by Michael Nielsen. It is undoubtedly the best resource for understanding neural networks. A must-read for anyone who is keen on diving deep into the fascinating field of deep learning.
