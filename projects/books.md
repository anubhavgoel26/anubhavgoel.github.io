I was never really a fan of books. Until my aunt gifted me _Open_, Andre Agassi’s autobiography, in August ’17. I thoroughly enjoyed it and have been reading both fiction and non-fiction since then.

My favourite genres are Mystery/Suspense, Memoirs and Science and Technology. <br> 
A short list of my favourite books:

* I'm a huge fan of Lee Child's Jack Reacher series. Each novel kept me on the edge and as the plot unfolded, putting the book down became more and more difficult! Here's a few of my favourites in no particular order:
    * Killing Floor
    * The Enemy
    * Gone Tomorrow


* My first mystery novel was Agatha Christie's _And Then There Were None_. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I further read _Murder on the Orient Express_ and _The Murder of Roger Ackroyd_. Both stories were gripping and I recommend it to every mystery/suspense lover.

* _Shoe Dog_, the memoir by Nike's founder Phil Knight, is an inspirational account of how Phil overcame numerous obstacles to build the greatest sports brand in the world. He is a master-storyteller!

* _Black Flags: The Rise of ISIS_ is a spine-chilling book about the emergence of the deadliest terrorist organisation in the world. 

* _The Gene: An Intimate History_ is a fascinating book about heredity. It is a dense read, with both scientific explanations about this mysterious concept, along with it's impact on not only the scientific community, but also our society!
