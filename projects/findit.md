Findit is a Python program which can identify segments of audio by searching a local database of audio clips/songs. It is similar to the popular music-discovery app Shazam.

Findit is inspired by [this](http://coding-geek.com/how-shazam-works/) brilliant article which explains each and every step in great detail with beautiful visualisations wherever necessary! Anyone interested in the realm of Audio Fingerprinting should go through all the sections of the article!

You can visit my Github [repo](https://github.com/methi1999/Findit) which contains the entire code, commented wherever required so that you can understand it and use it as a base for your further endeavours!
